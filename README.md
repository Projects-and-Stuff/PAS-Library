# PAS Library #
### A library of schematic symbols and circuit board footprints for KiCad ###

This will be an ever-expanding collection of KiCad Libraries and Modules. Our goal is three-fold:

1 To improve upon the basic libraries provided with KiCad
2 To provide all of the libraries and modules we've created in one place
3 To support innovation by providing simple access to component symbols and footprints not currently available


Current and Future Libraries:

* pas_rf.lib	=>	Radio Frequency (RF) Device Schematic Symbols
* pas_micro.lib	=>	Microcontrollers
* pas_cpld_fpga.lib	=>	All Complex Logic Devices and Gate Arrays
* pas_common.lib	=>	Generic and common schematic symbols
* pas_conn_term.lib	=>	Connector and Terminal Schematic Symbols
* 


Current and Future Modules:

* pas_conn_term.mod	=>	Connector and Terminal footprints
* pas_holes.mod	=>	Different sized holes for screws, etc
* pas_std_packages.mod	=>	Standard size IC packages like SOIC, DIP, and QFN
*
