### A library of schematic symbols and circuit board footprints for KiCad ###

This will be an ever-expanding collection of KiCad Libraries and Modules. Our goal is three-fold:
* To improve upon the basic libraries provided with KiCad
* To provide all of the libraries and modules we've created in one place
* To support innovation by providing simple access to component symbols and footprints not currently available
